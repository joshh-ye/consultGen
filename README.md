I am writing to provide you with an update on Jane, who was seen in our office on January 1, 2022, for an obstetric consultation regarding the management of her current pregnancy and her planned repeat cesarean section.

Jane is a 35-year-old female who is currently pregnant with her third child. Her obstetric history includes one previous live birth via cesarean section in 2019 and one abortion due to fetal health issues. Her first child was born at approximately 37 weeks with a birth weight of 2.5 kilograms. Jane had COVID-19 in 2021, following which she experienced heart pain. However, she has since been evaluated and is in good health. She is allergic to minocycline.

Upon review, Jane expressed her decision to proceed with a planned repeat cesarean section due to her previous cesarean delivery. We have scheduled this procedure for 39 weeks gestation. I have advised her to proceed to City Medical Center for an emergency cesarean section should labor commence before the scheduled date. Jane is encouraged to maintain daily walks of 20 to 30 minutes to support her blood pressure and the babyï¿½s health.

Our plan includes a follow-up appointment in three weeks, with subsequent visits every two weeks, and then weekly as her due date approaches. During our discussion, we reviewed the purpose of the cesarean section for a safe delivery and discussed the associated risks such as bleeding, infection, or injury to surrounding organs, albeit rare. Spinal anesthesia will be administered to ensure Jane's comfort while allowing her to remain conscious during the procedure.

Jane is currently active, participating in pregnancy yoga weekly, and walking when possible. She and her spouse have a supportive local friend network and plan to have postpartum assistance from her mother and a babysitter for two months.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions or require additional information regarding her care.

Best regards,
Dr. John Doe
