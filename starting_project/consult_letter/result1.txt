Thank you for referring Jane Smith for prenatal care consultation on October 26, 2023. Ms. Smith is a 32-year-old G2P1001 at approximately 9 weeks gestation by her last menstrual period, presenting with the chief complaint of mild nausea and fatigue, consistent with her prior pregnancy experience. Her history of present illness reveals symptoms beginning around 6 weeks, characterized by intermittent nausea primarily in the mornings, manageable without vomiting, and general fatigue. Review of systems is positive for mild breast tenderness but negative for vaginal bleeding, spotting, pelvic pain, dysuria, fever, chills, or severe vomiting. She denies any significant past medical or surgical history, and no prior gynecological issues were reported. Pertinent family history is unremarkable, and her obstetric history includes one prior uncomplicated term vaginal delivery. She is a non-smoker, consumes alcohol rarely, and denies recreational drug use; nutritional intake is generally good despite mild nausea. Current medications are a prenatal vitamin and occasional acetaminophen; she has no known drug allergies. Physical examination revealed a well-appearing female in no acute distress. Vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 118/74 mmHg. Abdominal exam showed a soft, non-tender abdomen without palpable masses or organomegaly; pelvic exam confirmed a small anteverted uterus consistent with early gestation, no adnexal masses, and normal external genitalia. Assessment confirms a viable intrauterine pregnancy at approximately 9 weeks gestation with mild symptoms of nausea and fatigue, consistent with normal early pregnancy. The plan includes initiating routine prenatal laboratory studies, scheduling a first-trimester ultrasound to confirm dating, providing dietary and lifestyle counseling for nausea management, and scheduling follow-up in 4 weeks for ongoing prenatal care. Please feel free to contact me with any questions regarding her care.

Sincerely,
Dr. Evelyn Reed
