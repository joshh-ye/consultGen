Thank you for referring Jane Smith for her initial obstetric consultation on July 1, 2024. Ms. Smith is a 31-year-old G2P1 at 10 weeks gestation based on her last menstrual period, which correlates with a recent ultrasound confirming her dates. Her primary concern is mild pelvic pressure, described as intermittent and non-radiating, beginning approximately two weeks ago without associated bleeding, dysuria, or significant urinary frequency changes. She otherwise reports feeling well, with positive pregnancy symptoms of mild nausea responsive to dietary adjustments and breast tenderness, but denies headaches, visual disturbances, or significant fatigue. Her nutritional history is unremarkable with routine prenatal vitamin use. She reports a prior uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery at term three years ago and no history of miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, or abortions. No significant past medical history was reported. Ms. Smith takes only prenatal vitamins daily and has no known medication allergies. She is a non-smoker, does not use alcohol or illicit substances, and works full-time in an office setting. Her past surgical history is not detailed in the provided referral information, nor were specific antenatal screening test results available for review at this consultation. Physical examination revealed a well-appearing patient with normal vital signs. Abdominal exam showed a soft, non-tender abdomen without masses or organomegaly; the uterus was palpable just above the symphysis pubis. Pelvic exam confirmed a closed cervix without lesions or discharge, and uterine size was consistent with dates with no adnexal masses or tenderness elicited.

Assessment confirms a 31-year-old G2P1 at approximately 10 weeks gestation experiencing mild pelvic pressure, likely related to normal physiological changes of early pregnancy, though ensuring continued monitoring for potential causes like urinary tract infection or cervical insufficiency is prudent. Overall, she presents as a healthy patient with a low-risk pregnancy thus far.

The plan includes initiating standard prenatal labs today, scheduling a nuchal translucency ultrasound around 12 weeks, and discussing prenatal screening options with genetic counseling as indicated. We reinforced routine prenatal care recommendations and advised Ms. Smith to report any increase in pelvic pressure, vaginal bleeding, or concerning symptoms. She will follow up in our clinic in four weeks for her next routine prenatal visit and review of initial lab results. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions regarding her ongoing care.

Sincerely,
Dr. Sarah Chen
